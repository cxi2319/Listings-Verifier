# Listings-Verifier

Takes a Yext and publisher listing, tokenizes it, and uses a dynamic programming function based on Damerau Levenshtein distance to calculate the Bayesian probability of token-level transformations between the Yext and publisher Listing value. This helps us determine whether a publisher listing is a verified listing, at scale.
